# JavascriptInterviewProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Installation and chosen dependencies/packages

Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install the projects with its dependencies. Asides from the standard installed generated during the generation process through Angular CLI, few dependencies have been installed:
- *ng bullet* and *ng mocks*, to increase testing speed and to simplify the writing process of additional unit tests.
- *Angular Material* to implement UI elements such as cards or sliders if required.
- *auth0* to bypass GitHub's daily restrictions to non-authenticated apps.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. The app will launch and open automatically on `http://localhost:4200/`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). The command `ng test:watch` was also included to provide the developer with a Watch mode.
